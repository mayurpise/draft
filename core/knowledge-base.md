# Knowledge Base

AI guidance during track creation must be grounded in vetted sources. When providing advice, cite the source to ensure credibility and traceability.

## Patterns

### Creational (GoF)
- Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton

## Anti-Patterns to Flag

### Distributed Systems
- **Fallacies of Distributed Computing** — Network reliability, zero latency, infinite bandwidth, secure network, topology stability, single admin, zero transport cost, homogeneous network
- **Distributed Monolith** — Microservices with tight coupling
- **Shared Database** — Services coupled through data

### Architecture
- **Big Ball of Mud** — No discernible structure
- **Golden Hammer** — Using one solution for everything
- **Cargo Cult** — Copying patterns without understanding
- **Premature Optimization** — Optimizing before measuring

### Code
- **God Class** — Class doing too much
- **Feature Envy** — Method more interested in other class's data
- **Shotgun Surgery** — Changes requiring many small edits across codebase
- **Leaky Abstraction** — Implementation details bleeding through interface

### Security
- **Security by Obscurity** — Hiding instead of securing
- **Trust on First Use** — Accepting unverified credentials
- **Hardcoded Secrets** — Credentials in source code

## Citation Format

When providing guidance, cite sources naturally:

> "Consider CQRS here (DDIA, Ch. 11) — separates read/write concerns which fits your high-read workload."

> "This violates the Dependency Rule (Clean Architecture) — domain shouldn't know about infrastructure."

> "Watch for N+1 queries (common GraphQL pitfall) — use DataLoader pattern."

> "Circuit breaker pattern (Release It!) would help here — fail fast instead of cascading timeouts."
