# Draft Methodology

**Measure twice, code once.**

Draft is a methodology for Context-Driven Development that ensures consistent, high-quality delivery through: **Context → Spec & Plan → Implement**.

## Philosophy

### The Core Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but undirected. Without structure, they:
- Make assumptions about requirements
- Choose arbitrary technical approaches
- Produce code that doesn't fit the existing codebase
- Lack accountability checkpoints

Draft solves this through **Context-Driven Development**: structured documents that constrain and guide AI behavior. By treating context as a managed artifact alongside code, your repository becomes a single source of truth that drives every agent interaction with deep, persistent project awareness.

### Why Each Document Exists

| Document | Purpose | Prevents |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `product.md` | Defines users, goals, success criteria | AI building features nobody asked for |
| `product-guidelines.md` | Style, branding, UX patterns | Inconsistent UI/UX decisions |
| `tech-stack.md` | Languages, frameworks, patterns | AI introducing random dependencies |
| `workflow.md` | TDD preference, commit style, review process | AI skipping tests or making giant commits |
| `spec.md` | Acceptance criteria for a specific track | Scope creep, gold-plating |
| `plan.md` | Ordered phases with verification steps | AI attempting everything at once |

### The Constraint Hierarchy

```
product.md          →  "Build a task manager for developers"
  ↓
tech-stack.md       →  "Use React, TypeScript, Tailwind"
  ↓
spec.md             →  "Add drag-and-drop reordering"
  ↓
plan.md             →  "Phase 1: sortable list, Phase 2: persistence"
```

Each layer narrows the solution space. By the time AI writes code, most decisions are already made.

### Keeping AI Constrained

Without constraints, AI will:
1. **Over-engineer** — add abstractions, utilities, "improvements" you didn't ask for
2. **Assume context** — guess at requirements instead of asking
3. **Lose focus** — drift across the codebase making tangential changes
4. **Skip verification** — claim completion without proving it works

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Explicit spec | AI can only implement what's documented |
| Phased plans | AI works on one phase at a time |
| Verification steps | Each phase requires proof of completion |
| Status markers | Progress is tracked, not assumed |

The AI becomes an executor of pre-approved work, not an autonomous decision-maker.

### Human Review Before AI Codes

**This is Draft's most important feature.**

The workflow:
1. Developer runs `/draft:new-track` — AI creates `spec.md` and `plan.md`
2. Developer reviews and edits these documents
3. Developer commits them for peer review
4. Team approves the approach
5. *Only then* does `/draft:implement` begin

| Traditional AI Coding | Draft Approach |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| AI writes code immediately | AI writes spec first |
| Review happens on code PR | Review happens on spec PR |
| Disagreements require rewriting code | Disagreements resolved before coding |
| AI decisions are implicit | AI decisions are documented |

**Benefits:**
- **Faster reviews** — Reviewers approve approach, not implementation details
- **Fewer rewrites** — Catch design issues before code exists
- **Knowledge transfer** — Specs document *why*, not just *what*
- **Accountability** — Clear record of what was requested vs. delivered
- **Onboarding** — New team members read specs to understand features

### When to Use Draft

**Good fit:**
- Features requiring design decisions
- Work that will be reviewed by others
- Complex multi-step implementations
- Anything where "just do it" has failed before

**Overkill:**
- One-line bug fixes
- Typo corrections
- Exploratory prototypes you'll throw away

Draft adds structure. Use it when structure has value.

### Problems with Chat-Driven Development

Traditional AI chat interfaces have fundamental limitations:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Context window fills up** | Long chats exhaust token limits; AI loses early context |
| **Hallucination increases with context size** | More tokens → more confusion → worse decisions |
| **No persistent memory** | Close the chat, lose the context |
| **Unsearchable history** | "Where did I work on feature X?" — good luck finding it |
| **No team visibility** | Your chat history is invisible to colleagues |
| **Repeated context loading** | Every session starts from zero |

### How Draft Solves This

| Draft Approach | Benefit |
|----------------|---------|
| **File-based context** | Persistent memory on the filesystem |
| **Git-tracked specs** | Version history, diffs, blame |
| **Scoped context loading** | Only load what's needed for the current track |
| **Fewer tokens used** | Smaller context → better AI decisions |
| **Searchable artifacts** | `grep` your specs, not chat logs |
| **Team-visible planning** | Specs and plans are PR-reviewable |

### The Economics

Writing specs feels slower. It isn't.

| Scenario | Without Spec | With Spec |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Simple feature | 1 hour | 1.2 hours |
| Feature with ambiguity | 3 hours + rework | 2 hours |
| Feature requiring team input | 5 hours + meetings + rework | 2.5 hours |
| Wrong feature entirely | Days wasted | Caught in review |

The overhead is constant (~20% for simple tasks). The savings scale with:
- **Complexity** — More moving parts = more value from upfront planning
- **Team size** — More reviewers = more value from documented decisions
- **Criticality** — Higher stakes = more value from discipline

For critical product development, Draft isn't overhead — it's risk mitigation.

## Core Workflow

```
Context → Spec & Plan → Implement
```

1. **Setup** - Initialize project context (once per project)
2. **New Track** - Create specification and plan
3. **Implement** - Execute tasks with optional TDD workflow
4. **Verify** - Confirm acceptance criteria met

## Tracks

A **track** is a high-level unit of work (feature, bug fix, refactor). Each track contains:

```
draft/tracks/<track-id>/
├── spec.md          # Requirements and acceptance criteria
├── plan.md          # Phased task breakdown
├── metadata.json    # Status and timestamps
└── jira-export.md   # Jira stories for export (optional)
```

### Track Lifecycle

1. **Planning** - Spec and plan are being drafted
2. **In Progress** - Tasks are being implemented
3. **Completed** - All acceptance criteria met
4. **Archived** - Track is archived for reference

## Project Context Files

Located in `draft/` of the target project:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `product.md` | Product vision, users, goals |
| `product-guidelines.md` | Style, branding, UX standards (optional) |
| `tech-stack.md` | Languages, frameworks, patterns |
| `workflow.md` | TDD preferences, commit strategy |
| `jira.md` | Jira project configuration (optional) |
| `tracks.md` | Master list of all tracks |

## Status Markers

Used throughout spec.md and plan.md:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending/New |
| `[~]` | In Progress |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[!]` | Blocked |

## Plan Structure

Plans are organized into phases:

1. **Foundation** - Core data structures, interfaces
2. **Implementation** - Main functionality
3. **Integration** - Connecting components
4. **Polish** - Error handling, edge cases, docs

### Task Granularity

Good tasks are:
- Completable in a focused session
- Have clear success criteria
- Produce testable output
- Fit in a single commit

## Jira Integration (Optional)

Sync tracks to Jira with a two-step workflow:

1. **Preview** (`/draft:jira-preview`) - Generate `jira-export.md` with epic and stories
2. **Review** - Adjust story points, descriptions, acceptance criteria as needed
3. **Create** (`/draft:jira-create`) - Push to Jira via MCP server

Story points are auto-calculated from task count:
- 1-2 tasks = 1 point
- 3-4 tasks = 2 points
- 5-6 tasks = 3 points
- 7+ tasks = 5 points

Requires `jira.md` configuration with project key, board ID, and epic link field.

## TDD Workflow (Optional)

When enabled in workflow.md:

1. **Red** - Write failing test first
2. **Green** - Implement minimum code to pass
3. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests green
4. **Commit** - Following project conventions

## Intent Mapping

Natural language patterns that map to Draft commands:

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "set up the project" | Initialize Draft |
| "new feature", "add X" | Create new track |
| "start implementing" | Execute tasks from plan |
| "what's the status" | Show progress overview |
| "undo", "revert" | Rollback changes |
| "the plan" | Read active track's plan.md |
| "the spec" | Read active track's spec.md |

## Quality Disciplines

### Verification Before Completion

**Iron Law:** Evidence before claims, always.

Every completion claim requires:
1. Running verification command IN THE CURRENT MESSAGE
2. Reading full output and confirming result
3. Showing evidence with the claim
4. Only then updating status markers

**Never mark `[x]` without:**
- Fresh test/build/lint run in this message
- Confirmation that output shows success
- Evidence visible in the response

### Systematic Debugging

**Iron Law:** No fixes without root cause investigation first.

When blocked (`[!]`):
1. **Investigate** - Read errors, reproduce, trace data flow (NO fixes yet)
2. **Analyze** - Find similar working code, list differences
3. **Hypothesize** - Single hypothesis, smallest possible test
4. **Implement** - Regression test first, then fix, verify

See `core/agents/debugger.md` for detailed process.

### Two-Stage Review

At phase boundaries:
1. **Stage 1: Spec Compliance** - Did implementation match specification?
2. **Stage 2: Code Quality** - Clean architecture, proper error handling, meaningful tests?

See `core/agents/reviewer.md` for detailed process.

## Communication Style

Lead with conclusions. Be concise. Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness.

- Direct, professional tone
- Code over explanation when implementing
- Complete, runnable code blocks
- Show only changed lines with context for updates
- Ask clarifying questions only when requirements are genuinely ambiguous

## Principles

1. **Plan before you build** - Create specs and plans that guide development
2. **Maintain context** - Ensure agents follow style guides and product goals
3. **Iterate safely** - Review plans before code is written
4. **Work as a team** - Share project context across team members
5. **Verify before claiming** - Evidence before assertions, always
