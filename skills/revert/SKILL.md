# Draft Revert

Perform intelligent git revert that understands Draft's logical units of work.

## Step 1: Analyze What to Revert

Ask user what level to revert:

1. **Task** - Revert a single task's commits
2. **Phase** - Revert all commits in a phase
3. **Track** - Revert entire track's commits

If user specifies by name/description, find the matching commits.

## Step 2: Find Related Commits

For Draft-managed work, commits follow pattern:
- `feat(<track_id>): <description>`
- `fix(<track_id>): <description>`
- `refactor(<track_id>): <description>`

```bash
# Find commits for a track
git log --oneline --grep="<track_id>"

# Find commits in date range (for phase)
git log --oneline --since="<phase_start>" --until="<phase_end>" --grep="<track_id>"
```

## Step 3: Preview Revert

Show user what will be reverted:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    REVERT PREVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Reverting: [Task/Phase/Track] "[name]"

Commits to revert (newest first):
  abc1234 feat(add-auth): Add JWT validation
  def5678 feat(add-auth): Create auth middleware
  ghi9012 test(add-auth): Add auth middleware tests

Files affected:
  src/auth/middleware.ts
  src/auth/jwt.ts
  tests/auth/middleware.test.ts

Plan.md changes:
  Task 2.1: [x] → [ ]
  Task 2.2: [x] → [ ]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Proceed with revert? (yes/no)
```

## Step 4: Execute Revert

If confirmed:

```bash
# Revert each commit in reverse order (newest first)
git revert --no-commit <commit1>
git revert --no-commit <commit2>
# ... continue for all commits

# Create single revert commit
git commit -m "revert(<track_id>): Revert [task/phase description]"
```

## Step 5: Update Draft State

1. Update `plan.md`:
   - Change reverted tasks from `[x]` to `[ ]`
   - Add revert note

2. Update `metadata.json`:
   - Decrement tasks.completed
   - Decrement phases.completed if applicable
   - Update timestamp

3. Update `draft/tracks.md` if track status changed

## Step 6: Confirm

```
Revert complete

Reverted:
  - [list of tasks/commits]

Updated:
  - draft/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md
  - draft/tracks/<track_id>/metadata.json

Git status:
  - Created revert commit: [sha]

The reverted tasks are now available to re-implement.
Run /draft:implement to continue.
```

## Abort Handling

If user says no to preview:
```
Revert cancelled. No changes made.
```

If git revert has conflicts:
```
Revert conflict detected in: [files]

Options:
1. Resolve conflicts manually, then run: git revert --continue
2. Abort revert: git revert --abort

Draft state NOT updated (pending revert completion).
```
