# Architecture: [Org/Product Name]

> Synthesized from [X] service contexts by `/draft:index` on [DATE].
> This is a **system-of-systems** view. For service internals, see individual service drafts.
> Re-running `/draft:index` will update auto-generated sections but preserve manual edits.

## System Overview

**Key Takeaway:** [One paragraph synthesizing overall system purpose from service summaries — what this platform does, who it serves, and its primary value proposition]

### System Topology

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "External"
        Users[Users/Clients]
        ThirdParty[Third-Party Services]
    end

    subgraph "Edge Layer"
        Gateway[API Gateway]
    end

    subgraph "Core Services"
        ServiceA[Service A]
        ServiceB[Service B]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        DB[(Database)]
        Cache[(Cache)]
    end

    Users --> Gateway
    Gateway --> ServiceA
    Gateway --> ServiceB
    ServiceA --> DB
    ServiceB --> Cache
```

## Service Directory

| Service | Responsibility | Tech | Status | Details |
|---------|---------------|------|--------|---------|
| [service-name] | [One-line responsibility] | [Primary tech] | ✓ Active | [→ architecture](../services/[name]/draft/architecture.md) |

> **Status:** ✓ Active = initialized and maintained, ○ Legacy = initialized but deprecated, ? = not initialized

## Shared Infrastructure

<!-- Extracted from common external dependencies across services -->

| Component | Purpose | Used By |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| [PostgreSQL] | [Primary datastore] | [service-a, service-b] |
| [Redis] | [Caching, sessions] | [service-a, service-c] |
| [RabbitMQ] | [Async messaging] | [service-b, service-d] |

## Cross-Service Patterns

<!-- Extracted from common conventions across service architecture.md files -->

| Pattern | Description | Services |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| [JWT Auth] | [All services validate JWT via auth-service] | [all] |
| [Event-Driven] | [Async events via message queue] | [notifications, reports] |

## Data Flows

### [Primary Flow Name]

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway
    participant ServiceA
    participant ServiceB
    participant DB

    Client->>Gateway: Request
    Gateway->>ServiceA: Route
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: Internal call
    ServiceB->>DB: Query
    DB-->>ServiceB: Result
    ServiceB-->>ServiceA: Response
    ServiceA-->>Gateway: Response
    Gateway-->>Client: Response
```
