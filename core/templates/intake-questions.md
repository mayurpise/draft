# Intake Questions

Structured questions for track creation. **Ask ONE question at a time.** Wait for user response before proceeding. Update drafts progressively.

---

## Flow Instructions

**CRITICAL:** This is a conversation, not a form. Follow this pattern for EACH question:

1. **Ask** — One question only. Wait for response.
2. **Listen** — Process the user's answer.
3. **Contribute** — Add your expertise (patterns, risks, alternatives, citations).
4. **Update** — Modify spec-draft.md with what's been established.
5. **Bridge** — Summarize briefly, then ask the next question.

**DO NOT** dump multiple questions at once. The value is in the dialogue.

- Summarize: "I've extracted [X, Y, Z]. I notice [gap] isn't covered yet."

**If no:**
- Acknowledge: "No problem. Let's build this from scratch together."
- Proceed to Phase 2

**Update spec-draft.md:** Add any extracted context to relevant sections.

## Anti-Patterns

**STOP if you're doing any of these:**

- ❌ Asking multiple questions at once
- ❌ Moving to next question before user responds
- ❌ Accepting answers without contributing expertise
- ❌ Not citing sources when giving advice
- ❌ Skipping checkpoints between phases
- ❌ Not updating drafts after each answer
- ❌ Rushing to finalization without thorough exploration

**The goal is collaborative understanding, not speed.**
