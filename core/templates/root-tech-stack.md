## Org Standards

### Languages

- **Primary**: [Most common language] — [X]% of services
- **Secondary**: [Second most common] — [Y]% of services
- **Specialized**: [Other languages] — approved for specific use cases

### Frameworks

| Purpose | Standard | Alternatives |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| HTTP API | [Framework] | [Approved alternatives] |
| Background Jobs | [Framework] | - |
| Testing | [Framework] | - |

### Data Storage

| Type | Standard | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| OLTP | PostgreSQL | Default for relational data |
| Document | MongoDB | Approved for specific use cases |
| Cache | Redis | Session, cache, rate limiting |
| Search | Elasticsearch | Full-text search requirements |

### Messaging

| Pattern | Standard |
|---------|----------|
| Async Events | RabbitMQ |

### Infrastructure

| Component | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Container | Docker |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

| [ml-service] | Python | Go/TypeScript | ML ecosystem requirements |
| [analytics] | MongoDB | PostgreSQL | Time-series workload |

> Add new variances via PR to this file. Variances without justification will be flagged.

## Shared Libraries

Internal libraries all services should use:

| Library | Purpose | Current Version |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| @org/auth-client | Auth service integration | 2.x |
| @org/logging | Structured logging | 1.x |
| @org/errors | Error handling patterns | 1.x |
| @org/config | Configuration management | 1.x |

## Code Patterns

Org-wide conventions:

| Pattern | Standard | Reference |
