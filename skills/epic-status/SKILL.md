# Epic Qualification Status

Qualify a Jira Epic by running a mandatory pipeline: collect Jira data, fetch documents (design doc, test plan), gather Gerrit code changes, audit quality via Draft commands, analyze test coverage, and produce a gap-analysis report with qualification verdict.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` = Epic Jira ID (e.g., `ENG-446236`, `PROJ-1234`)

## Red Flags — STOP if you're:

- Skipping Phase 0 prerequisites — MCP servers and `draft/` context are **required**
- Treating `context.md` as the final report — it's intermediate input for quality analysis
- Running `draft:deep-review` or `draft:bughunt` without `draft/` context existing
- Reporting a verdict without synthesizing deep-review AND bughunt AND test gap findings
- Ignoring unresolved stories or stories without Gerrit changes
- Skipping document collection — design docs and test plans are qualification inputs
- Generating the report via `draft:new-track` — write the report **directly** using the inline templates
- Omitting YAML metadata headers from generated files — every file in `draft/` requires them

---

## Pipeline Overview

```
Phase 0: Prerequisites & MCP Discovery       ← fail-fast, verify ALL MCPs
Phase 1: Epic & Story Collection              (Jira MCP)
Phase 2: Document Collection & Synthesis      (WebFetch / configured MCPs)
Phase 3: Code Change Collection               (Gerrit MCP)
Phase 4: Context Synthesis                    (generate context.md)
Phase 5: Quality Analysis                     (draft:deep-review, draft:bughunt, draft:coverage)
Phase 6: Test Gap Analysis                    (TestRail + coverage + acceptance criteria)
Phase 7: Report Generation                    (qualification-report.md + remediation-plan.md)
```

Every phase is mandatory. Each consumes output from previous phases.

---

## File Metadata Convention

**Every generated file** under `draft/epic-status/` must include this YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
project: "{PROJECT_NAME}"
epic_id: "{EPIC_ID}"
generated_by: "draft:epic-status"
generated_at: "{ISO_TIMESTAMP}"
phase: "{phase number that generated this file}"
git:
  branch: "{LOCAL_BRANCH}"
  commit: "{FULL_SHA}"
  commit_short: "{SHORT_SHA}"
  commit_date: "{COMMIT_DATE}"
  dirty: {true|false}
synced_to_commit: "{draft/.ai-context.md synced_to_commit or null}"
mcp_servers:
  jira: true
  code_review: "{gerrit|github|gitlab|none}"
  testrail: {true|false}
previous_run: "{path to previous qualification-report.md or null}"
---
```

Gather git metadata at pipeline start:
```bash
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse --short HEAD
git log -1 --format="%ci"
git status --porcelain | head -1
```

---

## Phase 0: Prerequisites & MCP Discovery

### 0.1 Validate Input

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as a Jira issue key:
- If matches `<PROJECT>-<NUMBER>` (e.g., `ENG-446236`, `PROJ-1234`): use as-is
- If numeric-only (e.g., `446236`): prompt user for project prefix — do NOT assume `ENG-`
- If invalid format: **STOP** with usage example

### 0.2 MCP Server Verification

Verify **all** required servers upfront:

| Server | Required? | Verification Call | On Failure |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Jira MCP | **Required** | `get_issue(key=<EPIC_ID>, prune_mode="minimal")` | **STOP**: "Jira MCP required." |
| Code Review MCP | **Required** | See detection table below | **DEGRADE**: skip Phase 3 code review checks, cap verdict at PARTIALLY QUALIFIED |
| TestRail MCP | Optional | Check if TestRail tools exist in environment | **DEGRADE**: flag as gap |
| Other MCPs | Optional | Discovered per-URL in Phase 2 | **DEGRADE**: fall back to WebFetch |

**Code Review MCP Detection** — try in order, use the first that responds:

| MCP | Detection Call | Confirms |
|-----|---------------|----------|
| Gerrit MCP | `get_change_details("1", options=[])` — expect error, confirms server responds | Gerrit code review |
| GitHub MCP | Check for GitHub tools (e.g., `get_pull_request`) in environment | GitHub PRs |
| GitLab MCP | Check for GitLab tools (e.g., `get_merge_request`) in environment | GitLab MRs |

Record the detected Code Review MCP type — Phase 3 adapts its calls accordingly. If none detected, Phase 3 collects file changes from Jira comments and direct codebase access only (no review quality metrics).

Record all available servers — this goes into the metadata and report.

### 0.3 Draft Context Verification

The working directory **must** have Draft context. `draft:deep-review`, `draft:bughunt`, and `draft:coverage` depend on it.

```
IF draft/.ai-context.md AND draft/architecture.md exist:
  → Use existing context
  → Read synced_to_commit from draft/.ai-context.md YAML frontmatter
  → Compare to current HEAD: git log --oneline <synced_to_commit>..HEAD -- . ':!draft/'
  → If >20 commits since sync: warn "Draft context may be stale — consider draft:init refresh"

ELSE:
  → Run draft:init to establish full project context
  → Wait for init to complete before proceeding — this is blocking
```

### 0.4 Check for Previous Runs

```bash
ls draft/epic-status/<EPIC_ID>/qualification-report.md 2>/dev/null
```

If a previous run exists:
- Note its `generated_at` timestamp for delta comparison in Phase 7
- Do NOT delete — the new run overwrites

### 0.5 Create Output Directory

```bash
mkdir -p draft/epic-status/<EPIC_ID>
```

Announce: "Starting Epic Qualification Pipeline for `<EPIC_ID>`"

---

## Phase 1: Epic & Story Collection

### 1.1 Epic Metadata

```
get_issue(key=<EPIC_ID>, prune_mode="full")
get_issue_description(issue_key=<EPIC_ID>)
get_issue_comments(issue_key=<EPIC_ID>, prune_mode="default")
```

From the full issue, extract and store: key, summary, status, assignee, priority, type, created, updated, labels, components, fix versions.

### 1.2 Extract Artifact Links

Scan epic description, custom fields, and comments for:

| Artifact | URL Patterns | Jira Field Names to Check |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Design Doc | `docs.google.com`, `confluence`, `sharepoint`, `notion`, `*.docx` attachments | "Design Doc Link", "Design Document", "Design Spec" |
| Test Plan | `testrail`, `confluence/test`, `testplan` | "Test Plan Link", "QA Plan", "Test Plan", "Validation Plan" |
| TestRail Results | TestRail URLs, embedded pass/fail data | "TestRail: Results", "Test Results", "QA Results" |

Also check:
- `get_linked_issues(issue_key=<EPIC_ID>)` for documentation-type tickets
- Jira attachments (design docs uploaded directly to the epic)

For each artifact: record URL, type, and hold for Phase 2.

### 1.3 Story Discovery

```
get_issues(jql="\"Epic Link\" = <EPIC_ID>", max_results=100, prune_mode="default")
```

**Pagination**: If `truncated: true`, increase `max_results` or make follow-up calls. Do not silently drop stories.

**Fallbacks** (try in order, stop when results found):
1. `get_issues(jql="parent = <EPIC_ID>", max_results=100)` — Jira Cloud uses `parent` instead of `Epic Link`
2. `get_linked_issues(issue_key=<EPIC_ID>, relationship_type="epic child")`
3. `get_linked_issues(issue_key=<EPIC_ID>)` — all links, filter child/subtask types

If all return zero: flag "no stories found", produce minimal report.

### 1.4 Story Enrichment

Per story:
```
get_issue(key=<STORY_ID>, prune_mode="default")
get_issue_comments(issue_key=<STORY_ID>, prune_mode="default")
```

Collect: key, summary, status, type, assignee, priority, created, updated, labels.
Extract from description: acceptance criteria (numbered list).
Extract from comments: Gerrit URLs / change IDs (see Phase 3.1 for patterns).
Extract from fields: "TestRail: Results" if present.

### 1.5 Sub-Task Collection

Per story, check for sub-tasks:
```
get_linked_issues(issue_key=<STORY_ID>, relationship_type="subtask")
```

Or parse the `subtasks` field from `get_issue(key=<STORY_ID>, prune_mode="full")`.

For each sub-task:
- Collect its Gerrit links from comments (same extraction as stories)
- Roll up sub-task Gerrit changes into the parent story's change set
- Do NOT treat sub-tasks as independent stories for gap analysis

### 1.6 Story Classification

| Classification | Criteria | Gerrit Changes Expected? |
|----------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Code-deliverable | Default for Story/Bug types | Yes |
| Non-code | Type=Task AND (labels contain "documentation"/"design"/"config-only"/"process" OR description states no code change) | No |
| Excluded | Status ∈ {Won't Do, Duplicate, Won't Fix, Cancelled}; or explicitly moved to different epic | No — excluded from gap analysis |

### 1.7 Verify Resolution

Check each code-deliverable story status:

| Status Category | Statuses | Flag |
|-----------------|----------|------|
| Resolved | Resolved, Done, Closed | None — passing |
| In Progress | In Progress, In Review, In QA | "IN PROGRESS — partial implementation, verify Gerrit changes" |
| Unresolved | Open, New, To Do, Reopened, Backlog | "UNRESOLVED — gap" |
| Blocked | Blocked, Impediment | "BLOCKED — escalation needed" |

Additional flags:
- No description or acceptance criteria → "INCOMPLETE SPEC — gap"
- Code-deliverable + no Gerrit links in comments → "NO CODE CHANGES — verify in Phase 3"

---

## Phase 2: Document Collection & Synthesis

### 2.1 Design Document

**Access strategy** (try in order, stop on success):
1. Google Doc + Google Drive MCP available → use MCP
2. Confluence page + Confluence MCP available → use MCP
3. WebFetch with the URL
4. Jira attachment → download via Jira MCP if supported
5. All fail → record URL + "could not access" + flag as process gap

**If content retrieved**, synthesize and write to `draft/epic-status/<EPIC_ID>/design-doc-synthesis.md` (with metadata header):
- Goals and scope
- Architecture / design decisions
- API changes, data model changes
- Key trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)

### 2.2 Test Plan & TestRail Data

**Test Plan document** — same access strategy as 2.1. Synthesize test strategy and coverage goals.

**TestRail integration** (if TestRail MCP available):
- Extract test suite/run IDs from: Test Plan URL path segments, Jira "TestRail: Results" field, or story-level TestRail references
- Fetch: test case ID, title, status (passed/failed/blocked/untested), mapped story
- Fetch: test run results, pass rate summary

**If TestRail MCP not available**:
- WebFetch on TestRail URLs
- Parse "TestRail: Results" Jira field for embedded data (pass/fail counts, test case references)

**Write to** `draft/epic-status/<EPIC_ID>/test-data-synthesis.md` (with metadata header):
- Total test cases with pass/fail/blocked/untested counts
- Test cases mapped to specific stories
- Stories without test cases (test gaps)

---

## Phase 3: Code Change Collection

### 3.1 Extract Gerrit Change IDs

From story and sub-task comments (Phase 1.4, 1.5), extract Gerrit identifiers using these patterns:

| Pattern | Example | Extract |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Full Gerrit URL | `https://gerrit.example.com/c/project/+/12345` | `12345` |
| Legacy Gerrit URL | `https://gerrit.example.com/#/c/12345/` | `12345` |
| Short Gerrit URL | `https://gerrit.example.com/12345` | `12345` |
| Change-Id in text | `Change-Id: I8473b95a1f...` | `I8473b95a1f...` |
| Gerrit link markdown | `[Gerrit](https://gerrit.example.com/c/project/+/12345)` | `12345` |

**Extraction approach**: Scan comment bodies for URLs containing the Gerrit host domain. Extract the numeric change number from the URL path. Also scan for `Change-Id:` patterns in commit-formatted comments.

Group result: `{STORY_ID: [change_id_1, change_id_2, ...]}`

Include sub-task changes rolled up under the parent story.

### 3.2 Gerrit MCP Per Change

For each change ID:

```
get_change_details(change_id, options=["ALL_REVISIONS", "MESSAGES", "REVIEWERS"])
  → status (NEW/MERGED/ABANDONED), owner, reviewers, labels, branch,
    insertions/deletions, patchset count (_number from revisions)

list_change_files(change_id, revision_id="current")
  → file paths, status (ADDED/MODIFIED/DELETED/RENAMED), lines_inserted, lines_deleted

get_commit_message(change_id, revision_id="current")
  → subject, body, author {name, email, date}, committer {name, email, date}

list_change_comments(change_id)
  → per-file comments with: message, author, unresolved (boolean), patch_set
```

### 3.3 Verification Checks

Per Gerrit change, evaluate:

| Check | Pass | Fail (= gap) | Severity |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|
| Change status | MERGED | NEW → "not merged"; ABANDONED → "abandoned" | Critical |
| Code-Review label | +2 granted | No +2, or -1/-2 present | High |
| Verified label | +1 (CI passed) | -1 or missing | High |
| Unresolved comments | Zero unresolved | Count > 0 | Medium |
| Patchset count | Informational | >5 = risk signal (note, not auto-fail) | Low |

### 3.4 Consolidated Change Set

After all stories + sub-tasks processed:

- **Deduplicated file list** grouped by top-level module/directory, with per-file change status (ADDED/MODIFIED/DELETED)
- **All Gerrit changes** with story attribution (one change may map to multiple stories via sub-tasks)
- **Unique authors** (from committer data) and **unique reviewers** (from reviewer data)
- **Review quality summary**: total changes, count MERGED with +2, count without +2, count with unresolved comments, average patchset count
- **Scope metrics**: total files changed, total insertions, total deletions
- **Test file classification**: Classify every file in the change set as **test** or **production**:

  | Language | Test File Patterns |
  |----------|--------------------|
  | Go | `*_test.go` |
  | Python | `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`, files under `tests/` |
  | Java/Kotlin | `*Test.java`, `*Tests.java`, `*Spec.kt`, files under `src/test/` |
  | JavaScript/TypeScript | `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`, files under `__tests__/` |
  | C/C++ | `*_test.cc`, `*_test.cpp`, `*_unittest.cc`, files under `test/` or `tests/` |
  | Rust | `#[cfg(test)]` modules, files under `tests/` |
  | General | Files under directories named `test/`, `tests/`, `testing/`, `spec/` |

  Also check `draft/tech-stack.md` for project-specific test conventions that override defaults.

  Per story, record:
  - Count of production files changed
  - Count of test files changed
  - **Test file ratio**: test files / total files (0% = no tests shipped with code)

### 3.5 Epic-Level Changes

Extract Gerrit links from **epic-level comments** (Phase 1.1). These are changes referencing the epic directly, not a specific story. Reconcile with per-story results — flag any epic-level changes not attributed to a story.

### 3.6 No Changes for Code Story

If a code-deliverable story has **no Gerrit changes** (including sub-tasks):
- Check epic-level changes for commit messages mentioning the story ID
- If still none: flag "implementation gap — no code changes found"

---

## Phase 4: Context Synthesis

Generate `draft/epic-status/<EPIC_ID>/context.md` (with metadata header) combining all data from Phases 1-3.

### Context Document Structure

#### Story Learnings
```

### Learnings Narrative Per Story

For **bug-fix stories** (5 sections):
1. **What was the issue** — Symptoms, scope, observables, impact. Generalize using patterns rather than raw ticket IDs.
2. **RCA** — Primary cause, contributing factors. Incorporate Gerrit reviewer insights from `list_change_comments` if relevant.
3. **Resolution** — Fix type, Gerrit change ID, branch, merge status, who reviewed. Reference patchset count.
4. **Journey** — Timeline: triage → investigation → fix → Gerrit review iterations → merge → verification.
5. **Learnings** — Technical, operational, process takeaways. Test gaps.

For **feature stories** (5 sections):
1. **What was the requirement** — Goal, user need, scope, acceptance criteria. Cross-reference design doc synthesis.
2. **Technical approach** — Design decisions, patterns, integration points.
3. **Implementation** — Key files from `list_change_files`, change scope (insertions/deletions).
4. **Journey** — Dev timeline, patchset iteration count, review feedback themes, testing.
5. **Learnings** — Reusable patterns, pitfalls, test coverage observations.

**Data sources:**

| Section | Primary | Supporting |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| What/requirement | `get_issue_description` | Design doc synthesis |
| RCA/approach | Pinned Jira comments, `get_linked_issues` | `list_change_comments` |
| Resolution/implementation | `list_change_files`, `get_commit_message` | Jira resolution field |
| Journey | Jira comments + Gerrit patchset history | TestRail execution timeline |
| Learnings | Derived from all above | Reviewer feedback, test gaps |

### Per-Story Detail (continued)

---

## Phase 5: Quality Analysis

All three commands use the `draft/` context established in Phase 0.

### 5.1 /draft:deep-review

Run per changed module. Module selection follows deep-review's own priority:
1. Check `draft/.ai-context.md` for `## Modules` or `## Module Catalog` — match against modules from the consolidated change set
2. If no module catalog: use top-level directories from the consolidated file list
3. Run once per affected module:

```
draft:deep-review <module-name-or-directory>
```

**Output**: `draft/deep-review-reports/<module-name>.md` (deep-review manages its own output path)

**Reads**: `draft/.ai-context.md`, `draft/product.md`, `draft/tech-stack.md`

Produces per-module: ACID compliance, resilience, observability, configuration assessment with per-finding severity and file:line references.

### 5.2 /draft:bughunt

Run scoped to specific file paths from the consolidated change set.

**Invocation protocol**: Bughunt prompts for scope type when invoked. Pre-answer the prompt:
1. Select **"Specific paths"** when bughunt asks for scope
2. Supply the consolidated file list from Phase 3.4 as the target paths
3. If bughunt asks for track context, respond: "No track — running as part of /draft:epic-status pipeline"

```
/draft:bughunt
→ (scope prompt) → "Specific paths"
→ (paths prompt) → <consolidated file list from Phase 3.4>
```

**Output**: `draft/bughunt-report.md` (bughunt manages its own output path)

**Reads**: `draft/.ai-context.md`, `draft/tech-stack.md`, `draft/product.md`, `draft/workflow.md`

Produces: severity-ranked bug list (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with code evidence, data flow traces, and optional regression tests.

### 5.3 /draft:coverage

Run with explicit path argument per changed module:

```
/draft:coverage <module-directory>
```

Coverage reads `coverage_target` from `draft/workflow.md` (default: **95%** if absent).

**Track requirement workaround**: `/draft:coverage` expects an active track and writes to `draft/tracks/<id>/coverage-report.md`. Since epic-status does not create a track:
1. Coverage will look for an active track from `draft/tracks.md` — if none exists, it will warn
2. Capture coverage output directly from the tool's console/response text
3. Record the coverage percentages, gap analysis, and uncovered files in the epic-status context document (Phase 4)
4. Reference coverage results by captured output, not by file path

**If no test framework is detected**: coverage will report this. Record "No test framework detected" in the report — this itself is a gap finding.

### 5.4 Partial Completion Handling

If any Phase 5 command fails:
- Record which commands completed and which failed
- Continue with remaining commands — do NOT abort the pipeline
- In Phase 7, note failed analyses: "draft:coverage — FAILED: no test framework detected" etc.
- Verdict must account for missing data: if bughunt failed, verdict cannot be QUALIFIED (insufficient evidence)

---

## Phase 6: Test Gap Analysis & Test Suggestions

Testing is a **first-class qualification signal**. This phase combines codebase test discovery, coverage analysis, and bughunt findings to identify every gap — then produces actionable, framework-specific test suggestions.

### 6.1 Codebase Test Discovery

For each changed **production** file from the consolidated change set (Phase 3.4):

1. **Find companion test files** in the codebase using conventions from `draft/tech-stack.md` and the patterns in Phase 3.4.
   - Example: `src/handler.go` → look for `src/handler_test.go`
   - Example: `src/utils/parser.ts` → look for `src/utils/parser.test.ts`, `src/utils/parser.spec.ts`, `src/utils/__tests__/parser.test.ts`

2. **If companion test file exists**: read it. Record:
   - Number of test functions/cases
   - What behaviors are tested (function names, describe blocks, test names)
   - Whether changed functions/methods have corresponding test cases
   - Last modified date (via Gerrit or git log) — stale tests are a signal

3. **If no companion test file exists**: flag `"NO TEST FILE — <production_file>"`

4. **Cross-module test files**: Some tests live in separate directories (e.g., `integration_tests/`, `e2e/`). Scan for test files that import or reference changed production files.

Build a **test inventory** per story:

| Production File | Companion Test File | Test Functions | Changed Functions Covered | Gap |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------:|:-------------------------:|-----|
| src/handler.go | src/handler_test.go | 8 | 3/5 | 2 uncovered |
| src/parser.go | — | — | — | No test file |

### 6.2 Test Presence in Gerrit Changes

From Phase 3.4 test file classification:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Story ships test files + production files | Developer tested their changes — positive |
| Story ships only production files, companion tests exist unchanged | Developer modified code but didn't update tests — **stale test risk** |
| Story ships only production files, no companion tests in codebase | No tests at all — **critical gap** |
| Story ships only test files | Test-only change (backfill, refactor) — positive signal |

Per story, assign a **Test Shipping Status**:
- **TESTED**: Gerrit changes include test files covering the production changes
- **PARTIALLY TESTED**: Some production files have companion tests (unchanged or in different changes)
- **UNTESTED**: No test files shipped, no companion tests in codebase
- **TEST BACKFILL**: Test-only changes (positive)

### 6.3 Acceptance Criteria → Test Mapping

Per code-deliverable story:
1. Extract acceptance criteria (from Phase 1.4)
2. Map to **codebase tests** discovered in 6.1 (test function names that exercise the criterion)
3. Map to **TestRail test cases** (from Phase 2.2, if available) — if TestRail unavailable, leave column blank and weight codebase tests + coverage higher
4. Map to **bughunt findings** that exercise the same code path
5. Identify criteria with **no test coverage at all** — these are the highest-priority gaps

**Without TestRail**: AC → test mapping relies entirely on codebase test discovery (6.1) and coverage data (5.3). This is still valid — many enterprise teams have comprehensive unit/integration tests that never appear in TestRail. The TestRail column becomes N/A in all tables.

| # | Story | Acceptance Criterion | Codebase Tests | TestRail Cases | Bughunt Overlap | Status |
|----|-------|---------------------|:--------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|--------|
| 1 | ENG-111 | "User can reset password" | 2 tests | TC-1001 | — | Covered |
| 2 | ENG-111 | "Email sent within 30s" | 0 | — | — | **GAP** |

### 6.4 Code Coverage Gap Identification

From draft:coverage (Phase 5.3) and codebase discovery (6.1):

1. **Changed files below coverage target** (from `draft/workflow.md`, default 95%)
2. **Newly ADDED files** (Gerrit `status: ADDED`) with zero or no test coverage
3. **Critical modules** flagged by deep-review that also have low coverage — highest severity
4. **Production files with no companion test file** at all in the codebase (from 6.1)
5. **Changed functions without test coverage** — map specific function/method changes (from Gerrit diff) to test function inventory

### 6.5 Regression Tests from Bughunt Findings

For **each Critical and High severity finding** from draft:bughunt (Phase 5.2):

1. Identify the vulnerable code path and entry points
2. Determine what input/state triggers the bug
3. Design a regression test that:
   - Reproduces the exact scenario that would trigger the bug
   - Asserts the correct behavior after the fix
   - Includes negative cases (malformed input, boundary values, race conditions)

This ensures bugs found by bughunt don't ship — and if they're already in code, they get caught on the next change.

### 6.6 Test Suggestions

Read `draft/tech-stack.md` for: test framework, assertion library, mocking patterns, test directory conventions.
Read `draft/workflow.md` for: TDD preferences, coverage targets, test execution commands.
Read `draft/.ai-context.md` for: existing test patterns, module boundaries, data flows.

Generate **framework-specific, copy-pasteable test suggestions** for every identified gap.

#### Unit Tests — for uncovered production code

For each production file/function without adequate test coverage:

```
Test:     <descriptive_test_function_name>
Type:     Unit
Priority: Critical / High / Medium
Story:    <STORY_ID>
Gap:      <what's untested — specific function, branch, error path>
File:     <target test file path — companion location>
Tests:    <what behavior/scenario this validates>
Why:      <which gap from 6.1/6.3/6.4 this closes>

Sketch:
```<language>
<actual test function using project's framework, assertion library, and conventions>
<include setup/teardown if needed>
<test the specific changed function with meaningful assertions>
```
```

**Focus areas** (in priority order):
1. Changed functions with zero test coverage
2. Error handling paths — every error return/throw in changed code needs a test
3. Boundary conditions — nil/null, empty, max values, off-by-one
4. Concurrency paths flagged by deep-review (race conditions, deadlocks)
5. Input validation — changed code that processes external input

#### Regression Tests — for bughunt findings

For each Critical/High bughunt finding (from 6.5):

```
Test:     regression_<bug_description>
Type:     Regression
Priority: Critical (matches bughunt severity)
Story:    <STORY_ID>
Bug:      <bughunt finding reference>
File:     <target test file path>
Tests:    <reproduces the exact bug scenario>
Why:      Prevents regression of <bughunt finding>

Sketch:
```<language>
<test that sets up the vulnerable state>
<triggers the code path that had the bug>
<asserts correct behavior — the bug does NOT manifest>
```
```

#### Integration Tests — for cross-module changes

When Gerrit changes span multiple modules (from Phase 3.4 consolidated change set):

```
Test:     integration_<module_a>_<module_b>_<scenario>
Type:     Integration
Priority: High
Stories:  <STORY_IDs that touch both modules>
File:     <integration test directory>/test_<scenario>.<ext>
Tests:    <interaction between modules — data flow, API contract, event handling>
Why:      Cross-module changes risk breaking integration points

Sketch:
```<language>
<set up both modules with test fixtures>
<exercise the integration point changed by the epic>
<assert end-to-end behavior across module boundary>
```
```

**Trigger conditions** for integration test suggestions:
- Stories whose Gerrit changes touch files in 2+ modules
- Changes to interface/API boundary files identified in `draft/.ai-context.md`
- Data model changes that propagate across modules
- Event/message producer-consumer pairs where both sides changed

### 6.7 Test Adequacy Score

Compute a composite score from all discovery and analysis:

| Metric | Value | Weight | Score |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Stories with test files in Gerrit changes | X/Y | 25% | |
| Production files with companion test files | X/Y | 20% | |
| Acceptance criteria with test coverage | X/Y | 20% | |
| Code coverage vs target | X% vs Y% | 15% | |
| Bughunt Critical/High with regression tests | X/Y | 10% | |
| New files (ADDED) with test coverage | X/Y | 10% | |

**Test Adequacy = weighted sum (0-100%)**

| Rating | Range | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Strong** | ≥80% | Tests ship with code, high coverage, gaps are minor |
| **Adequate** | 60-79% | Most code tested, some gaps in new/changed code |
| **Weak** | 40-59% | Significant test gaps — many stories without tests |
| **Critical Gap** | <40% | Insufficient testing — blocks qualification |

## Phase 7: Report Generation

Generate outputs **directly** to `draft/epic-status/<EPIC_ID>/`. Do NOT use `draft:new-track`.

### 7.1 Verdict Logic

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **QUALIFIED** | All code stories ∈ {Resolved, Done, Closed} + all Gerrit changes MERGED with Code-Review +2 + zero Critical/High bugs + design doc accessible + test plan accessible + zero unresolved review comments on critical changes + coverage at target + Test Adequacy ≥80% (Strong) |
| **PARTIALLY QUALIFIED** | Minor gaps: Medium bugs only, non-critical artifacts missing, 1-2 stories In Progress with merged changes, some unresolved comments, coverage below target but >70%, Test Adequacy 40-79% (Adequate/Weak) |
| **NOT QUALIFIED** | Any: unresolved code stories with no changes, Gerrit changes not merged, Critical bugs, missing design doc AND test plan, requirements not traced to code, critical module FAIL in deep-review, Phase 5 commands failed, Test Adequacy <40% (Critical Gap) |

**If Phase 5 partially failed**: verdict cannot exceed PARTIALLY QUALIFIED due to insufficient evidence.

| Story In Progress | Flag separately from Unresolved, collect available changes |
| Gerrit change not found | Flag per-story, continue with other changes |
| No changes for code story | Flag "implementation gap" |
| draft:init fails | **STOP** — context required for quality analysis |
| draft/ exists but stale | Warn, proceed (note in report) |

| draft:bughunt fails | **DEGRADE** — record failure, continue pipeline, cap verdict at PARTIALLY QUALIFIED |
| draft:coverage fails / no framework | **DEGRADE** — record, flag "no coverage data" as gap |
| 50+ stories | Process in batches of 25, warn about duration |
| Jira MCP rate limit / timeout | Back off with exponential delay, retry up to 3 times per call |
