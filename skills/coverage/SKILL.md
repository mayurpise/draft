description: Compute code coverage for active track or module. Targets 95%+ coverage with report and justification for uncovered lines. Complements TDD workflow.

# Coverage Report

You are computing and reporting code coverage for the active track or a specific module. This complements the TDD workflow — TDD is the process (write test, implement, refactor), coverage is the measurement (how much code do those tests exercise).

## Red Flags - STOP if you're:

- Reporting coverage without actually running the coverage tool
- Making up coverage percentages
- Skipping uncovered line analysis
- Not presenting the report for developer approval
- Treating this as a replacement for TDD (it's not — TDD stays in `/draft:implement`)

---

## Step 1: Load Context

1. Read `draft/tech-stack.md` for test framework and language info
2. Find active track from `draft/tracks.md`
3. If track has `architecture.md`, identify current module for scoping
4. Read `draft/workflow.md` for coverage target (default: 95%)

If no active track and no argument provided:
- Tell user: "No active track. Provide a path or track ID, or run `/draft:new-track` first."

## Step 2: Detect Coverage Tool

Auto-detect from tech stack:

| Language | Coverage Tools |
|----------|---------------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `jest --coverage`, `vitest --coverage`, `c8`, `nyc` |
| Python | `pytest --cov`, `coverage run`, `coverage.py` |
| Go | `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out` |
| Rust | `cargo tarpaulin`, `cargo llvm-cov` |
| C/C++ | `gcov`, `lcov` |
| Java/Kotlin | `jacoco`, `gradle jacocoTestReport` |
| Ruby | `simplecov` |

**Detection order:**
1. Check `tech-stack.md` for explicit testing section
2. Check config files (`jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`, `.nycrc`)
3. Check `package.json` scripts for coverage commands
4. If not detectable, ask the developer which tool and command to use

## Step 3: Determine Scope

**Priority order:**
1. If argument provided (path or module name): use as scope filter
2. If track has `architecture.md` with an in-progress module: scope to that module's files
3. If active track exists: scope to files changed in the track (use `git diff` against base branch)
4. Fallback: run coverage for entire project

Build the coverage command with the appropriate scope/filter flags.

## Step 4: Run Coverage

1. Execute the coverage command
2. Capture full output
3. If command fails:
   - Check if dependencies are installed (test framework, coverage plugin)
   - Suggest installation command
   - Ask developer to fix and retry

## Step 5: Parse and Present Report

Parse coverage output and present in a standardized format:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                     COVERAGE REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Track: [track-id]
Module: [module name, if applicable]
Target: [from workflow.md, default 95%]

SUMMARY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall: 87.3% (target: 95%)  ← BELOW TARGET

PER-FILE BREAKDOWN
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
src/auth/middleware.ts    96.2%  PASS
src/auth/jwt.ts           72.1%  FAIL
src/auth/types.ts        100.0%  PASS

UNCOVERED LINES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
src/auth/jwt.ts:45-52    Error handler for malformed token
src/auth/jwt.ts:78       Defensive null check (unreachable via public API)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Step 6: Analyze Gaps

For files below target:

1. **Identify uncovered lines** - List specific line ranges and what they contain
2. **Classify each gap:**
   - **Testable** - Can and should be covered. Suggest specific test to write.
   - **Defensive** - Assertions, error handlers for impossible states. Acceptable to leave uncovered.
   - **Infrastructure** - Framework boilerplate, main entry points. Usually acceptable.
3. **Suggest tests** for testable gaps:
   ```
   SUGGESTED TESTS
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1. Test malformed JWT token handling (jwt.ts:45-52)
      - Input: token with invalid signature
      - Expected: throws AuthError with code INVALID_TOKEN

   2. Test expired token rejection (jwt.ts:60-65)
      - Input: token with exp in the past
      - Expected: throws AuthError with code TOKEN_EXPIRED
   ```

## Step 7: Developer Review

### CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY)

**STOP.** Present the full coverage report and gap analysis.

Ask developer:
- Accept current coverage? (if at or above target)
- Write additional tests for testable gaps?
- Justify and document acceptable uncovered lines?
- Adjust coverage target for this track?

**Wait for developer approval before recording results.**

## Step 8: Record Results

After developer approves:

1. **Update plan.md** - Add coverage note to the relevant phase:
   ```markdown
   **Coverage:** 96.2% (target: 95%) - PASS
   - Uncovered: defensive null checks in jwt.ts (justified)
   ```

2. **Update architecture.md** (if exists) - Add coverage to module status:
   ```markdown
   - **Status:** [x] Complete (Coverage: 96.2%)
   ```

3. **Update metadata.json** - Add coverage field if not present:
   ```json
   {
     "coverage": {
       "overall": 96.2,
       "target": 95,
       "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
     }
   }
   ```

## Completion

Announce:
```
Coverage report complete.

Overall: [percentage]% (target: [target]%)
Status: [PASS / BELOW TARGET]
Files analyzed: [count]
Gaps documented: [count testable] testable, [count justified] justified

Results recorded in:
- plan.md (phase notes)
- architecture.md (module status) [if applicable]
- metadata.json (coverage data)
```

## Re-running Coverage

When coverage is run again on the same track/module:
1. Compare with previous results
2. Show delta: "Coverage improved from 87.3% to 96.2% (+8.9%)"
3. Highlight newly covered lines
4. Update all records with latest results
