- **[User Type 1]**: [Their needs across the platform]
- **[User Type 2]**: [Their needs across the platform]

## Service Capabilities

| Capability | Provided By | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| [Capability] | [service-name] | [Brief description] |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

<!-- Extracted from common patterns across services -->

- **Authentication**: [How auth works across services]
- **Observability**: [Common logging/tracing approach]
- **Data Privacy**: [Compliance patterns]

<!-- MANUAL START -->
## Strategic Context

[Add manual strategic context, roadmap notes, or business priorities here — preserved on re-index]
