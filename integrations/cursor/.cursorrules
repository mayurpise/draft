# Draft - Context-Driven Development

You are operating with the Draft methodology for Context-Driven Development.

**Measure twice, code once.**

## Core Workflow

**Context → Spec & Plan → Implement**

Every feature follows this lifecycle:
1. **Setup** - Initialize project context (once per project)
2. **New Track** - Create specification and plan
3. **Implement** - Execute tasks with TDD workflow
4. **Verify** - Confirm acceptance criteria met

## Project Context Files

When `draft/` exists in the project, always consider:
- `draft/product.md` - Product vision and goals
- `draft/tech-stack.md` - Technical constraints
- `draft/workflow.md` - TDD and commit preferences
- `draft/tracks.md` - Active work items

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@draft setup` | Initialize project (run once) |
| `@draft new-track <description>` | Create feature/bug track |
| `@draft implement` | Execute tasks from plan |
| `@draft status` | Show progress overview |
| `@draft revert` | Git-aware rollback |

## Intent Mapping

Recognize these natural language patterns:

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "set up the project" | Run setup |
| "new feature", "add X" | Create new track |
| "start implementing" | Execute implement |
| "what's the status" | Show status |
| "undo", "revert" | Run revert |
| "the plan" | Read active track's plan.md |
| "the spec" | Read active track's spec.md |

## Tracks

A **track** is a high-level unit of work (feature, bug fix, refactor). Each track contains:
- `spec.md` - Requirements and acceptance criteria
- `plan.md` - Phased task breakdown
- `metadata.json` - Status and timestamps

Located at: `draft/tracks/<track-id>/`

## Status Markers

Recognize and use these throughout plan.md:
- `[ ]` - Pending
- `[~]` - In Progress
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[!]` - Blocked

## TDD Workflow

When implementing tasks (if TDD enabled in workflow.md):

1. **Red** - Write failing test first
2. **Green** - Implement minimum to pass
3. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests green

## Setup Command

When user says "set up draft" or "@draft setup":

1. Check if `draft/` already exists
2. If not, create project context through dialogue:
   - Ask about product vision and users
   - Detect or ask about tech stack
   - Ask about TDD and commit preferences
3. Create:
   - `draft/product.md`
   - `draft/tech-stack.md`
   - `draft/workflow.md`
   - `draft/tracks.md`
   - `draft/tracks/` directory

## New Track Command

When user says "new feature" or "@draft new-track <description>":

1. Load context from `draft/` files
2. Generate track ID (kebab-case from description)
3. Create `draft/tracks/<track-id>/` with:
   - `spec.md` - Requirements through dialogue
   - `plan.md` - Phased task breakdown
   - `metadata.json` - Status tracking
4. Update `draft/tracks.md`

## Implement Command

When user says "implement" or "@draft implement":

1. Find active track from `draft/tracks.md`
2. Load spec.md and plan.md
3. Find next pending task (`[ ]` or resume `[~]`)
4. Execute with TDD workflow if enabled
5. Update progress in plan.md and metadata.json
6. Commit after each task

## Status Command

When user says "status" or "@draft status":

1. Read `draft/tracks.md`
2. For each active track, read metadata.json
3. Display:
   - Active tracks with progress
   - Current phase and task
   - Blocked items
   - Recent completions

## Proactive Behaviors

1. **Context Loading** - Always read relevant draft files before acting
2. **Progress Tracking** - Update plan.md and metadata.json after each task
3. **Verification Prompts** - Ask for manual verification at phase boundaries
4. **Commit Suggestions** - Suggest commits following workflow.md patterns

## Error Recovery

If user seems lost:
- Check status to orient them
- Reference the active track's spec.md for requirements
- Suggest next steps based on plan.md state
