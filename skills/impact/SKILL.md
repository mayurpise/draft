# Draft Impact: Track Telemetry & Analytics

Generate a project-wide impact report measuring Context-Driven Development effectiveness across all tracks.

## Red Flags - STOP if you're:
- Profiling code coverage instead of measuring track-level impact.
- Rewriting tracker logic when local state objects are available for inspection.
- Generating reports without reading existing track metadata first.

## Execution Constraints

1. **Load Track State:**
   - Read all `draft/tracks.md` entries.
   - For each track, read `metadata.json` to extract: `created_at`, `updated`, `status`, phase counts, task counts.
   - If no tracks exist, report "No tracks found. Run `/draft:new-track` to create your first track."

2. **Compute Metrics:**
   - **Delivery Pace:** Average elapsed time from track creation to completion (planning → implementation → review).
   - **Phase Duration:** Time spent in each phase (planning, implementation, review). Flag any phase exceeding 14 days without updates.
   - **Completion Rate:** Ratio of completed tracks to total tracks.
   - **Task Granularity:** Average tasks per track. Flag tracks with fewer than 3 tasks (under-decomposed) or more than 30 (over-decomposed).

3. **Friction Detection:**
   - Scan `git log` for revert commits associated with each track.
   - High revert count (>2 per track) signals unclear specification boundaries.
   - Flag tracks that moved backward (e.g., from implementation back to planning).

4. **Architectural Impact:**
   - Count ADRs created (`draft/adrs/`).
   - Count guardrail entries added via `/draft:learn`.
   - Count modules decomposed via `/draft:decompose`.

5. **Report Output:**
   Generate a Markdown report with sections:
   - **Summary:** Total tracks, completed, in-progress, abandoned.
   - **Delivery Pace:** Average and median track duration.
   - **Friction Hotspots:** Tracks with highest revert counts, longest stalls, or phase regressions.
   - **CDD Adoption:** ADR count, guardrail growth, decomposition usage.
   - **Recommendations:** Actionable suggestions based on detected friction patterns.
