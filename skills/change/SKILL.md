description: Handle mid-track requirement changes. Analyzes impact on completed and pending tasks, proposes amendments to spec.md and plan.md before applying.

# Course Correction

You are handling a mid-track requirement change using Draft's Context-Driven Development methodology.

## Red Flags - STOP if you're:

- Applying changes to spec.md or plan.md without showing the user what will change first
- Invalidating `[x]` completed tasks without flagging them explicitly
- Proceeding past the CHECKPOINT without user confirmation
- Editing files when the user said "no" or "edit"

**Show impact before applying. Always confirm.**

---

## Step 1: Parse Arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **Change description** — free text describing what needs to change (required)
- **Track specifier** — optional `track <id>` prefix to target a specific track

### Default Behavior

If no `track <id>` specified:
- Auto-detect the active `[~]` In Progress track from `draft/tracks.md`
- If no `[~]` track, find the first `[ ]` Pending track
- Display: `Auto-detected track: <id> - <name>` before proceeding

If no change description provided:
- Error: "Usage: `/draft:change <description>` or `/draft:change track <id> <description>`"

---

## Step 2: Load Context

1. Read `draft/tracks/<id>/spec.md` — extract requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Read `draft/tracks/<id>/plan.md` — extract all tasks with their current status (`[ ]`, `[~]`, `[x]`, `[!]`)
3. Read `draft/tracks/<id>/metadata.json` — for track type and status

---

## Step 3: Analyze Spec Impact

Analyze the change description against the loaded spec.

For each requirement and acceptance criterion, classify the effect:

| Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Added** | New requirement or AC introduced by this change |
| **Modified** | Existing requirement or AC needs updating |
| **Removed** | Existing requirement or AC is no longer needed |
| **Unaffected** | No change needed |

Produce a concise impact list. Example:
```
Spec impact:
- AC #2 "User can export to CSV" → Modified (now also requires JSON format)
- AC #5 "Export limited to 1000 rows" → Removed (no row limit)
- NEW: AC #6 "Export progress indicator for large datasets"
```

---

## Step 4: Map Impact to Plan Tasks

For each task in `plan.md`, determine if the spec change affects it:

- **`[x]` completed tasks** that are now invalidated by the change → flag as:
  `⚠️ [task description] — may need rework`

- **`[ ]` pending tasks** that need updating → show the proposed new task text

- **`[~]` in-progress tasks** that are affected → flag as:
  `⚠️ IN PROGRESS: [task description] — review before continuing`

- **Unaffected tasks** — skip, do not mention

---

## Step 5: Present Impact Summary

Display a clear summary before proposing any file changes:

```
Change: [change description]
Track:  <track_id> — <track_name>

Spec impact:
  - [classification] [requirement/AC]
  - [classification] [requirement/AC]

Plan impact:
  - ⚠️ [N] completed task(s) may need rework
  - [M] pending task(s) need updating
  - [K] in-progress task(s) need review

Completed tasks that may need rework:
  - [x] [task description] (commit: abc1234)

Pending tasks with proposed changes:
  Before: - [ ] [original task text]
  After:  - [ ] [proposed new task text]
```

---

## Step 6: Show Proposed Amendments

Display only the changed sections of each file (not full rewrites):

### Proposed spec.md changes

Show the diff as before/after for each modified section. Do not rewrite unchanged sections.

### Proposed plan.md changes

Show each task that would be modified as before/after. Do not rewrite the full plan.

---

## Step 7: CHECKPOINT

```
Apply these changes to spec.md and plan.md? [yes / no / edit]
```

- **`yes`** — proceed to Step 8
- **`no`** — discard all proposed changes, announce "No changes applied." and stop
- **`edit`** — let the user describe adjustments to the proposed amendments, then revise and re-present before asking again

---

## Step 8: Apply Changes and Log

1. Apply the agreed amendments to `spec.md` and `plan.md`

2. Update `draft/tracks/<id>/metadata.json`:
   - Set `updated` to current ISO timestamp

3. Append a Change Log entry to `plan.md`. If a `## Change Log` section does not exist, add it at the bottom:

```markdown
## Change Log

| Date | Description | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [ISO date] | [change description] | [N completed may need rework, M pending updated] |
```

4. Announce:

```
Changes applied: <track_id>

Updated:
- draft/tracks/<id>/spec.md
- draft/tracks/<id>/plan.md

[If completed tasks flagged:]
⚠️  Review N completed task(s) — they may not align with the updated spec.
    Re-run /draft:implement to address rework, or /draft:review to assess.

Next: /draft:implement to continue, or /draft:review to assess current state.
```

## Error Handling

### Track Not Found
```
Error: Track '<id>' not found.
Run /draft:status to see available tracks.
```

### No Active Track
```
Error: No active track found.
Use: /draft:change track <id> <description>
```

### No Spec or Plan
```
Error: Missing spec.md or plan.md for track <id>.
Cannot perform change analysis without both files.
```

---

## Examples

### Change description for active track
```bash
/draft:change the export format should support JSON in addition to CSV
```

### Targeting a specific track
```bash
/draft:change track add-export-feature also require a progress indicator for exports over 500 rows
```
