## Generation Contract (read first)

Every agent or human editor of this file MUST observe the following rules. Violations are completeness failures.

### Sources

Every `##` heading carries a `Source:` marker. Author content only from that source:

| Source | Meaning | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `graph` | Rendered from `draft/graph/` between `<!-- GRAPH:*:START/END -->` fences | `draft:init` render pass, not the LLM |
| `manifest` | Extracted deterministically from `package.json` / `go.mod` / `Cargo.toml` / `requirements.txt` / `pom.xml` / Bazel `BUILD` / `pyproject.toml` | Scanner, not the LLM |
| `code-scan` | Deterministic scan (file tree, CODEOWNERS, OpenAPI, `.proto`, config parsers) | Scanner, not the LLM |
| `user-input` | Captured during `draft:init` interview; never inferred from code | User, captured verbatim |
| `llm-synthesis` | Narrative from reading code. Word budget is mandatory | LLM, bounded |

### Absence is signal

There are **no quotas** in this template. Do not pad to hit a count. If a section does not apply:

```
N/A — reason: {one-sentence justification referencing classification or codebase facts}.
```

Examples:
- `N/A — reason: project_type == 'library'; no HTTP surface.`
- `N/A — reason: single-threaded CLI; no concurrency primitives in use.`
- `N/A — reason: no proto/OpenAPI/GraphQL definitions present in repository.`

### Citations

Every `path:line` reference must resolve at `synced_to_commit`. If a citation cannot be verified (file moved, line out of range, commit unknown), write it as:

```
[unverified] path/to/file.ext:123
```

`draft:init` runs a post-generation verification pass that rewrites unresolved citations to this form. Do not attempt to guess or invent locations.

### Word budgets

Every `llm-synthesis` section carries a hard word cap. Exceeding the cap is a failure, not a feature. Cut to fit; do not expand neighbor sections to compensate.

### Classification gates

Each section declares `Required:` at one of four levels:
- `always` — every codebase, every run. Cannot be N/A.
- `standard+` — required when `criticality ∈ {standard, high, mission-critical}`.
- `high+` — required when `criticality ∈ {high, mission-critical}`.
- `mission-critical` — required only at that criticality.

Sections below the declared level MAY be N/A with reason; sections at or above MUST be populated.

### Do not regenerate untouched sections

If a section's source set (the files or graph tables it depends on) has not changed since the last run, leave the section byte-identical. `draft/.state/freshness.json` records per-section hashes. Re-derivation without source change is the single largest cause of cross-model divergence and is prohibited.

### Section metadata block

Every `##` heading is immediately followed by:

```
> **Source:** <one of the 5 sources above>
> **Required:** always | standard+ | high+ | mission-critical
> **Length:** rendered | ≤N words | ≤N rows | table | N/A
> **N/A when:** {precise, machine-checkable condition}
> **Verification:** graph-fence | citation-check | schema-check | manifest-diff | none
```

## 1. Executive Summary

> **Source:** llm-synthesis
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** ≤200 words
> **N/A when:** never
> **Verification:** citation-check

One paragraph, plain prose, no bullets. State what the system IS, what it DOES, and its role. Open with a single sentence that would stand alone as the whole summary if truncated. No marketing language.

**Key Facts** (exactly these rows, fill or mark N/A):

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Language & Version | {e.g., TypeScript 5.3} |
| Entry Point | `{path:line}` → `{symbol}` |
| Architecture Style | {Hexagonal / Layered / Microservice / Pipeline / Actor / N/A} |
| Component Count | {integer from graph} |
| Primary Data Sources | {databases, queues, APIs read from — or N/A} |
| Primary Action Targets | {databases, services, files written to — or N/A} |
| Deployment Model | {binary / container / lambda / library artifact / daemon / N/A} |

---

## 2. AI Agent Quick Reference

> **Source:** code-scan + manifest + user-input
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** table, fixed rows
> **N/A when:** never
> **Verification:** citation-check + manifest-diff

Compact block optimized for agent context loading. Every field populated or explicit "N/A".

```
Module              : {PROJECT_NAME}
Root Path           : ./
Language            : {e.g., Go 1.21, Python 3.12, TypeScript 5.3}
Build               : {exact command, e.g., `bazel build //path:target`, `npm run build`}
Test                : {exact command, e.g., `pytest -q`, `go test ./...`}
Entry Point         : {file:line → symbol}
Config System       : {gflags / .env + YAML / Viper / Spring / environment / N/A}
Extension Point     : {interface + registration site — or N/A}
API Definition      : {path to .proto / OpenAPI / GraphQL — or N/A}
Key Config Prefix   : {MODULE_* env / module.* YAML / --module-* CLI — or N/A}
CODEOWNERS          : {path — or "none"}
Security Contact    : {from ownership block}
On-Call             : {from ownership block — or "none"}
```

**Before Making Changes, Always:**

1. {Primary invariant check — the #1 thing that must not break, citing §15 entry}
2. {Thread-safety / async-safety consideration — or "single-threaded — no concerns"}
3. {Test command to run after changes — copy from `Test` row above}
4. {API / schema versioning rule — or "N/A"}

**Never:**

- {Critical safety rule 1 — cite §15 or §16}
- {Critical safety rule 2}
- {Critical safety rule 3}

List exactly the rules that apply. If fewer than three apply, list fewer. Do not pad.

---

## 3. System Identity & Purpose

> **Source:** user-input
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** ≤300 words
> **N/A when:** never
> **Verification:** none

Captured during `draft:init` interview. Do not infer purpose or business rationale from code — ask the user.

**What this system IS** (≤60 words).

**What this system DOES** (≤60 words, bullet list of top-level capabilities).

**Who uses it** (≤40 words — internal teams / external customers / automated systems).

**Non-Goals** (explicit list; what this system will not do, to prevent scope creep).

**Upstream producers** (systems that send data or requests into this one — or N/A).

**Downstream consumers** (systems that receive data or requests from this one — or N/A).

---

## 4. Architecture Overview

> **Source:** llm-synthesis + graph
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** ≤400 words + one Mermaid diagram
> **N/A when:** never
> **Verification:** graph-fence (topology)

### 4.1 High-Level Topology

<!-- GRAPH:module-topology:START -->
<!-- Rendered by draft:init. If absent, emit:
     N/A — reason: graph artifacts not present. Run '/draft:init' or 'graph --repo . --out draft/graph' to populate. -->
<!-- GRAPH:module-topology:END -->

### 4.2 Narrative

≤400 words describing the topology in prose. Name the architectural style (hexagonal, layered, pipeline, actor, event-driven, plugin-host, monorepo, polyrepo) and justify from observable evidence (directory structure, dep graph, call boundaries).

### 4.3 Lifecycle Model

Choose one applicable model and fill only its rows. Delete rows that do not apply; do not force-fit.

| Model | Phases | Describe only if applicable |
|---|---|---|
| Long-running service | startup → ready → steady-state → drain → shutdown | |
| Short-lived CLI | parse-args → execute → exit | |
| Batch/ETL | trigger → extract → transform → load → ack | |
| Library | no lifecycle — N/A | |
| Actor/reactive | spawn → receive → handle → terminate | |

---

## 5. Component Map & Interactions

> **Source:** graph
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** rendered
> **N/A when:** never (graph absent → explicit N/A with reason)
> **Verification:** graph-fence

### 5.1 Module Dependency Graph

<!-- GRAPH:module-deps:START -->
<!-- Rendered from draft/graph/module-graph.jsonl (nodes + edges).
     Emits Mermaid graph + dependency matrix. No LLM prose inside fence. -->
<!-- GRAPH:module-deps:END -->

### 5.2 Component Interaction Matrix

<!-- GRAPH:integration-edges:START -->
<!-- Rendered matrix: rows = source module, cols = target module, cells = edge kind
     (calls / imports / emits-event / reads-schema). -->
<!-- GRAPH:integration-edges:END -->

### 5.3 Boundary Types

A short table listing the interaction kinds present. Rendered from graph edge taxonomy.

| Boundary Kind | Count | Example |
|---|---|---|
| in-process call | {n} | `moduleA.Foo` → `moduleB.Bar` |
| inter-process RPC | {n} | {service → service} |
| async message | {n} | {producer → topic → consumer} |
| shared database | {n} | {table} |

---

## 6. Data Flow — End to End

> **Source:** llm-synthesis + graph
> **Required:** standard+
> **Length:** ≤500 words + 1–N diagrams (no minimum)
> **N/A when:** criticality == low AND no external data ingress/egress
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 6.1 Primary Flow

One Mermaid sequence diagram for the dominant request/job flow. Every actor named must map to a module in §5. Every arrow labeled with the call/message type.

### 6.2 Flow Variants

One diagram per variant that meaningfully differs (sync vs async, read vs write, happy vs error). Omit entirely if the system has only one flow — do not pad.

### 6.3 Data Transformation Stages

Table only if the system has explicit transformation stages (ETL, pipeline, compiler). Otherwise omit.

| Stage | Input Shape | Transform | Output Shape | Implementation `path:line` |
|---|---|---|---|---|

---

## 7. Core Modules Deep Dive

> **Source:** graph + llm-synthesis
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** ≤300 words per module narrative; enumerate every module the graph emits
> **N/A when:** never
> **Verification:** graph-fence per module + citation-check

For each module returned by `draft/graph/module-graph.jsonl`, emit a subsection with identical structure. Do not sample. Do not summarize. Every module that exists in the graph gets a slot.

### 7.{N} {module-name}

<!-- GRAPH:module-deep/{module-name}:START -->
<!-- Rendered deterministic block: path, file count, public API list, fan-in, fan-out,
     hotspot score, primary deps. No LLM prose inside fence. -->
<!-- GRAPH:module-deep/{module-name}:END -->

**Role** (≤40 words). What this module is responsible for.

**Public Surface**. Enumerate every exported symbol from the graph's `public_api` table for this module. Format: `symbol_name (kind) — path:line`. No sampling.

**Key Invariants** (cite §15 entries by number). If none apply, write `None.`

**Sub-modules**. If the module has sub-directories with source files, recurse. Each sub-module gets the same structure at one heading level deeper. Depth is bounded by the graph, not by a page target.

---

## 8. Concurrency Model & Thread Safety

> **Source:** llm-synthesis
> **Required:** standard+
> **Length:** ≤400 words
> **N/A when:** single-threaded (no goroutines, threads, async runtime, workers) — write `N/A — reason: single-threaded {language} {entry-point}. No shared mutable state across execution contexts.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 8.1 Execution Model

One-sentence statement. E.g., "Go runtime with bounded worker pool sized from `GOMAXPROCS`." Cite the entry-point `path:line`.

### 8.2 Shared State

Enumerate every location of shared mutable state. One row per location. If zero, write `None.`

| Kind | Location `path:line` | Protection | Contention Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| {mutex / atomic / channel / DB row / cache entry} | | {lock / CAS / transaction / actor ownership} | {low / medium / high — with rationale} |

### 8.3 Locking & Ordering

If multiple locks are acquired, state the global acquisition order. If violating the order causes deadlock, mark the rule as an invariant and cite §15.

### 8.4 Async/Await Surface

Languages with async runtimes (TS, Python asyncio, Rust tokio, Kotlin coroutines): describe the executor, cancellation policy, and any blocking calls. Otherwise omit.

---

## 9. Framework & Extension Points

> **Source:** code-scan
> **Required:** standard+ (when plugin/handler/middleware system exists)
> **Length:** tables, no minimum
> **N/A when:** no plugin, handler, middleware, strategy, or visitor system exists — write `N/A — reason: monolithic; no extension surface.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 9.1 Extension Types

| Type | Interface | Registration Site `path:line` | Example Impl `path:line` |
|---|---|---|---|

### 9.2 Registration Mechanism

One sentence: explicit-call / decorator / convention-based-scan / config-driven / DI-container. Cite the mechanism's `path:line`.

### 9.3 Core Interfaces

For each interface in §9.1, show the exact declaration, citing `path:line`. Do not paraphrase. If the declaration exceeds 25 lines, show signature only and link to `path:line`.

```{language}
// path:line — verbatim
```

---

## 10. Full Catalog of Implementations

> **Source:** graph
> **Required:** standard+ (when §9 is populated or operation/handler pattern exists)
> **Length:** rendered
> **N/A when:** §9 is N/A AND no operation/handler directories exist
> **Verification:** graph-fence

### 10.1 By Category

<!-- GRAPH:catalog:START -->
<!-- Rendered from draft/graph/{go,python,ts,c}-index.jsonl (per-language symbol indexes).
     Group implementations by category (handlers, operations, strategies, extractors, etc.).
     One row per implementation. No sampling, no summarization. -->
<!-- GRAPH:catalog:END -->

### 10.2 Per-Directory Operation Lists

For each operation-bearing directory, render a complete list from the graph. One table per directory.

<!-- GRAPH:catalog-per-dir:START -->
<!-- Rendered per-directory enumeration. -->
<!-- GRAPH:catalog-per-dir:END -->

---

## 11. Secondary Subsystem (V2 / Redesign)

> **Source:** user-input
> **Required:** standard+ (when V2/redesign present)
> **Length:** ≤400 words
> **N/A when:** no parallel or next-generation subsystem exists — write `N/A — reason: single subsystem; no parallel V2 or redesign in flight.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 11.1 Architecture

One Mermaid flowchart of the redesigned subsystem. Same notation as §5.

### 11.2 Key Differences from V1

| Aspect | V1 / Legacy | V2 / Current |
|---|---|---|

Enumerate only differences that materially affect behavior or operations. Cosmetic differences (renames, reorg) do not belong here.

### 11.3 Coexistence & Migration

State how V1 and V2 coexist (traffic split, feature flag, shadow mode, dual-write) and the cutover criterion. Cite the flag or switch `path:line`.

### 11.4 Framework Details

Key source files and their roles. Enumerate; do not sample.

---

## 12. API & Interface Definitions

> **Source:** code-scan (proto / OpenAPI / GraphQL / route registration)
> **Required:** standard+ (when any external API exists)
> **Length:** rendered
> **N/A when:** project_type == 'library' AND no network-exposed surface — write `N/A — reason: library artifact; public surface documented in §7 Public Surface tables.`
> **Verification:** graph-fence + schema-check

### 12.1 Endpoints

<!-- GRAPH:api-endpoints:START -->
<!-- Rendered from OpenAPI / proto / route-registration parsers.
     Columns: Method, Path, Handler path:line, Auth, Rate Limit, SLO. -->
<!-- GRAPH:api-endpoints:END -->

### 12.2 Proto / Schema Definitions

<!-- GRAPH:api-proto:START -->
<!-- Rendered from draft/graph/proto-index.jsonl. One row per service and message. -->
<!-- GRAPH:api-proto:END -->

### 12.3 Data Models

Table of the top-level request/response/event models the API exposes. Cite declaration `path:line` for each.

| Model | Kind (request / response / event / shared) | Declaration `path:line` | Versioning Rule |
|---|---|---|---|

### 12.4 Definition Files

Enumerate every `.proto`, `openapi.yaml`, `schema.graphql`, or equivalent. Give the file path and its role.

---

## 13. External Dependencies

> **Source:** manifest
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** rendered table
> **N/A when:** never (zero deps → table with one row: "None. Language standard library only.")
> **Verification:** manifest-diff

### 13.1 Runtime Dependencies

<!-- GRAPH:external-deps:kind=runtime:START -->
<!-- Rendered from package manifest(s). Columns: Name, Version, License, Source, Transitive Count, Used-In (top 3 modules). -->
<!-- GRAPH:external-deps:kind=runtime:END -->

### 13.2 Build / Dev Dependencies

<!-- GRAPH:external-deps:kind=dev:START -->
<!-- Rendered for dev/test/build-only deps. -->
<!-- GRAPH:external-deps:kind=dev:END -->

### 13.3 Service Dependencies (network-reachable)

| Service | Protocol | Client Path `path:line` | Criticality | Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Only for systems the runtime reaches over the network (databases, queues, third-party APIs). For libraries or pure CPU workloads: `None.`

---

## 14. Cross-Module Integration Points

> **Source:** graph + llm-synthesis
> **Required:** standard+
> **Length:** ≤300 words per integration
> **N/A when:** single-module system — write `N/A — reason: single-module; no cross-module integration surface.`
> **Verification:** graph-fence + citation-check

For each integration edge of kind `rpc` / `queue` / `shared-db` / `shared-schema` in the graph:

### 14.{N} {Source} ↔ {Target}

- **Contract** — API version, schema revision, response format, latency SLO.
- **Failure Isolation** — circuit breaker, timeout, retry, bulkhead, fallback. Cite `path:line`.
- **Version Coupling** — compatibility window; who upgrades first; flag gating.
- **Integration Tests** — how tested; where the tests live `path:line`.

---

## 15. Critical Invariants & Safety Rules

> **Source:** llm-synthesis
> **Required:** always (may be `None.`)
> **Length:** ≤30 words per invariant; enumerate all that apply; do not pad
> **N/A when:** never — if the codebase has zero invariants, write `None. No data-integrity, concurrency, or security invariants identified.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

No quota. Enumerate every invariant that actually exists. One row per invariant.

| # | Invariant | Category | Where Enforced `path:line` | Enforcement Mechanism | Violation Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | {precise statement} | {data / concurrency / security / resource / ordering} | `{path:line}` | {type-system / runtime-assert / test / code-review / none} | {what breaks if violated} |

**Mission-critical rule.** Any invariant in categories `data` or `security` with `Enforcement Mechanism == none` MUST be flagged for review. List such invariants at the end of the table with `⚠ unenforced` prefix.

---

## 16. Security Architecture

> **Source:** llm-synthesis + user-input
> **Required:** high+
> **Length:** ≤500 words
> **N/A when:** criticality == low AND no authentication, authorization, crypto, PII, or network ingress — write `N/A — reason: criticality=low; no auth, crypto, PII, or external ingress.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 16.1 Threat Model Scope

Name the threat model's in-scope and out-of-scope items. Cite the threat-model doc if one exists; if not, state `No formal threat model on file.` and list the top three assumed threats.

### 16.2 Authentication & Authorization

Mechanism(s) in use. Cite the primary auth middleware or guard `path:line`. State the authorization model (RBAC / ABAC / ACL / capability / none).

### 16.3 Crypto Primitives

| Purpose | Library + Version | Algorithm | Key Source | `path:line` |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Mark `None.` if no crypto in use.

### 16.4 Secret Handling

How secrets are loaded (env / vault / KMS / file). Where rotation is triggered. Cite config loader `path:line`.

### 16.5 Known CVE Mitigations (mission-critical only)

Only if any dependency's CVE required explicit mitigation. Otherwise omit the subsection.

---

## 17. Observability & Telemetry

> **Source:** code-scan + llm-synthesis
> **Required:** high+
> **Length:** ≤400 words
> **N/A when:** criticality == low OR project_type == 'library' — write `N/A — reason: {...}`.
> **Verification:** citation-check + graph-fence (metrics)

### 17.1 Golden Signals

| Signal | Metric Name | Dashboard URL | Alert URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Latency | | | |
| Traffic | | | |
| Errors | | | |
| Saturation | | | |

### 17.2 Logging

Log library + version. Log level policy. Structured vs free-form. PII redaction policy. Cite `path:line` for the logger init.

### 17.3 Tracing

Tracing library (OpenTelemetry / Zipkin / X-Ray / none). Trace context propagation points. Sampling policy.

### 17.4 Alert Runbook

Link to runbook(s). Mission-critical requires at least one runbook URL or inline entry.

### 17.5 Log Retention

Retention period. Where logs are stored. Who has read access.

---

## 18. Error Handling & Failure Modes

> **Source:** llm-synthesis
> **Required:** standard+
> **Length:** ≤400 words
> **N/A when:** project_type == 'library' AND errors are returned unchanged to the caller — write `N/A — reason: pure library; errors propagate verbatim to caller.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 18.1 Error Taxonomy

| Error Class | Source | Retry Policy | User-Visible? | `path:line` |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Enumerate classes that actually exist. Do not invent categories.

### 18.2 Failure Modes Beyond Errors

| Mode | Trigger | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| {timeout / partial write / data loss / deadlock / corruption / OOM / thundering herd} | | | |

Only rows for modes the codebase or deployment actually exhibits. Omit if none.

### 18.3 Graceful Degradation

If any component has fallback behavior, describe it here with `path:line`. Otherwise write `None — all failures surface as errors to caller.`

---

## 19. State Management & Persistence

> **Source:** code-scan + user-input
> **Required:** standard+ (when persistence exists); mission-critical sections below are `high+`
> **Length:** ≤400 words + SLO table for mission-critical
> **N/A when:** stateless — write `N/A — reason: stateless; all state is request-scoped.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 19.1 State Stores

| Store | Kind (SQL / KV / blob / cache / queue / filesystem) | Library `path:line` | Durability |
|---|---|---|---|

### 19.2 Schema & Migrations

Migration tool name + version. Migration directory path. Cite the migration runner `path:line`. State forward/backward compatibility policy.

### 19.3 Durability, RPO, RTO (mission-critical only)

| Store | Durability Model | RPO | RTO | Backup Cadence | Restore Drill Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Mission-critical requires every row populated. Unknown values → mark `⚠ undefined` and raise as §27 debt.

### 19.4 Caching

Layers, invalidation policy, TTLs. Cite `path:line` for each cache.

---

## 20. Reusable Modules for Future Projects

> **Source:** llm-synthesis + graph
> **Required:** standard+
> **Length:** tables
> **N/A when:** project_type == 'cli' AND fewer than 3 modules — write `N/A — reason: monolithic CLI; no modules separable for reuse.`
> **Verification:** graph-fence

Tiered by how much of the module's surface is reusable outside this project.

### 20.1 Highly Reusable (Framework-Level)

<!-- GRAPH:reusable:tier=framework:START -->

## 21. Key Design Patterns

> **Source:** llm-synthesis
> **Required:** standard+
> **Length:** ≤150 words per pattern + one verified code reference
> **N/A when:** no non-trivial patterns identified — write `None. Codebase follows straight-line procedural design.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

For each pattern that materially shapes the codebase:

### 21.{N} {Pattern name}

- **Intent** — one sentence.
- **Where used** — list occurrences with `path:line`. At least one citation must verify.
- **Why chosen** — one sentence referencing observable constraint (not aesthetic).
- **Reference snippet** — ≤15 lines, verbatim from `path:line`.

Do not enumerate every GoF pattern. Only patterns that recur or are load-bearing.

## 22. Configuration & Tuning

> **Source:** code-scan
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** rendered
> **N/A when:** never (zero config → `None. No runtime configuration surface.`)
> **Verification:** graph-fence + citation-check

### 22.1 Configuration Surface

<!-- GRAPH:config:START -->
<!-- Rendered from config parsers: env vars, CLI flags, YAML keys.
     Columns: Key, Type, Default, Where Read path:line, Valid Range / Enum. -->
<!-- GRAPH:config:END -->

### 22.2 Tuning Guidance

Only for knobs with non-obvious tradeoffs. One row per knob. Omit if none.

| Knob | Default | Raise when | Lower when | Risk of wrong value |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 23. Performance Characteristics & Hot Paths

> **Source:** graph (hotspots) + llm-synthesis
> **Required:** standard+
> **Length:** ≤200 words per hot path
> **N/A when:** project_type == 'library' AND no measured performance constraint — write `N/A — reason: library; performance characterization is caller-dependent.`
> **Verification:** graph-fence

### 23.1 Hotspots (graph-derived)

<!-- GRAPH:hotspots:START -->
<!-- Rendered from draft/graph/hotspots.jsonl. Columns: Path, Fan-In, Fan-Out, Change-Frequency, Hotspot Score. -->
<!-- GRAPH:hotspots:END -->

### 23.2 Critical Hot Paths

For each hot path that matters operationally:

#### 23.2.{N} {Path name}

- **Trace** — entry-point `path:line` → terminal `path:line`.
- **Observed characteristic** — measured latency / throughput / memory. Cite the measurement source (benchmark file, load test, production metric URL). If unmeasured, write `⚠ unmeasured` and log a §27 debt item.
- **Known optimizations** — what has already been done.
- **Known risks** — what would slow this path.

**Mission-critical rule.** Every hot path must have a measured baseline. `⚠ unmeasured` on a mission-critical system is a release blocker.

### 23.3 Measured Baselines (mission-critical only)

| Hot Path | p50 | p95 | p99 | Measured At (commit + date) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 24. How to Extend — Step-by-Step Cookbooks

> **Source:** llm-synthesis
> **Required:** standard+ (when §9 or §10 populated)
> **Length:** ≤400 words per cookbook
> **N/A when:** §9 is N/A — write `N/A — reason: no extension surface (see §9).`
> **Verification:** citation-check

One cookbook per extension type in §9.1. Each cookbook is an ordered step list. Every step cites `path:line` or a command. Test every step as you write by resolving citations.

### 24.{N} How to add a new {extension type}

1. ...
2. ...
3. Register at `path:line`.
4. Test with `{command}`.

No invented extension types. If a pattern is theoretically supported but has never been exercised, say so explicitly.

## 25. Build System & Development Workflow

> **Source:** manifest + code-scan
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** rendered
> **N/A when:** never
> **Verification:** graph-fence + manifest-diff

### 25.1 Build Tooling

| Tool | Version | Config File | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

### 25.2 Key Build Targets

<!-- GRAPH:build-targets:START -->
<!-- Rendered from Makefile / BUILD / package.json scripts / pyproject scripts. -->
<!-- GRAPH:build-targets:END -->

### 25.3 Developer Setup

Ordered command list, starting from a fresh clone. Every command must run to completion on a supported OS/arch. Cite the OS/arch matrix.

### 25.4 CI Pipeline

| Stage | Tool | Config `path:line` | Required for merge? |
|---|---|---|---|

---

## 26. Testing Infrastructure

> **Source:** code-scan
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** rendered table + ≤200 words
> **N/A when:** never (zero tests → `None. No automated tests present.` + flag as §27 debt item)
> **Verification:** citation-check

### 26.1 Test Suites

| Suite | Location | Command | Kind (unit / integration / e2e / property / fuzz / load) | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### 26.2 Test Data & Fixtures

Where fixtures live. How they are generated or maintained. Cite `path:line`.

### 26.3 Flaky Test Policy

If flaky tests exist and have a known handling policy (quarantine, retry, skip-with-ticket), describe it. Otherwise omit.

---

## 27. Known Technical Debt & Limitations

> **Source:** user-input (debt items must be acknowledged, not inferred)
> **Required:** always (may be `None.`)
> **Length:** ≤30 words per item
> **N/A when:** never — zero debt → `None. No known debt items at synced_to_commit.`
> **Verification:** citation-check

No quota. Enumerate every real item. One row per item.

| # | Item | Severity | Blast Radius | Owner | ETA | `path:line` or ticket |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | {statement} | {low / medium / high / critical} | {module / subsystem / org} | {team-or-person} | {date or "backlog"} | `{path:line}` or `JIRA-1234` |

**Mission-critical rule.** Every high/critical row must have Owner and ETA populated.

## 28. Glossary

> **Source:** user-input + code-scan
> **Required:** always
> **Length:** table
> **N/A when:** never (zero jargon → `None. Codebase uses standard terminology only.`)
> **Verification:** none

| Term | Definition | First Appears `path:line` or §ref |
|---|---|---|

Only terms that are non-standard in the broader industry OR carry project-specific meaning. Do not define standard terms ("mutex", "HTTP").

## Appendix D: Mermaid Sequence Diagrams — Critical Flows

> **Source:** llm-synthesis
> **Required:** high+
> **Length:** 1–N diagrams, no minimum, no maximum
> **N/A when:** criticality < high AND no flow crosses more than two modules — write `N/A — reason: {...}`.
> **Verification:** citation-check (every participant must map to a §5 component)

Diagrams for flows that are operationally critical and NOT already covered by §6. Each diagram must:

- name every participant with the exact component name from §5;
- label every arrow with the call/message kind;
- cite the entry-point and terminal `path:line` below the diagram.

Do not duplicate §6 diagrams. If §6 already covers the flow, skip it here.
